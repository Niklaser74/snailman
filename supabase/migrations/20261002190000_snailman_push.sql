-- Snailman's own push subscriptions. snails_push_subscriptions has no game
-- column, so every notify function sends to all of a user's rows: Snailman's
-- notices reached the other games' service workers on snails.se, and theirs
-- reached Snailman's. Snigelkrattan and Snail Story keep their own tables; so
-- does Snailman now, sharing only the VAPID key.
--
-- The shared table cannot tell which rows are Snailman's, so the clients move
-- them: snailman_save_push saves the subscription here and deletes the same
-- endpoint from the shared table. js/push.js calls it on every start while a
-- subscription exists, so a browser is moved the next time Snailman opens.
-- An endpoint belongs to one service worker, so deleting it there is safe.
